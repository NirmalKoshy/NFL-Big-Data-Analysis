We have utilized several key datasets to provide valuable insights and drive meaningful actions in our analysis of NFL games. Additionally, we developed a custom "Victory Dataset" to help uncover important information for further exploration. Below are the datasets used:

Games Dataset: This dataset contains detailed information about NFL games across various seasons, with each game uniquely identified by a "gameId." It offers a clear overview of game events and outcomes.

Player Dataset: This dataset provides rich information about individual NFL players, including their physical attributes and performance history. It helps in understanding player profiles and career trajectories.

Plays Dataset: This dataset focuses on the specifics of each play in NFL games, offering insights into game strategies, play types, and performance metrics. It's essential for analyzing play-by-play actions.

Tracking_week_1 Dataset: This dataset captures the real-time movements of players during games, including their positions, speeds, and accelerations. It offers a granular view of player dynamics throughout plays.

Victory Dataset: Our custom dataset, the Victory Dataset, focuses on capturing victory-related data, helping to analyze patterns of success and identify factors contributing to a team's triumphs.

These datasets collectively provide a comprehensive view of NFL games, players, and outcomes, enabling more informed analysis and decision-making.
